A collection of production-ready pallets for FRAME compatible blockchains that extend the [PolkadotSDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk). As true believers in the future potential of Polkadot and decentralized technologies, we're committed to building robust, secure, and scalable solutions that contribute to the broader Web3 ecosystem.

## üåü Our Vision

At Virto, we envision a future where decentralized technologies empower individuals and organizations through transparent, secure, and efficient systems. Our contribution to the Polkadot ecosystem represents our commitment to this vision, providing essential building blocks for the next generation of blockchain applications.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Substrate pallets that can be integrated into any FRAME-compatible blockchain. These pallets provide additional functionality beyond the core Substrate framework, designed for production use cases. Each pallet has been carefully crafted with security, scalability, and usability in mind.

## Getting Started

To use these pallets in your Substrate runtime:

1. Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
frame-contrib = { git = "https://github.com/virto-network/frame-contrib.git" }
```

2. Import the desired pallets in your runtime:
```rust
use frame_contrib::pallets::{
    pass,
    communities,
    gas_transaction_payment,
    // ... other pallets
};
```

## Available Pallets

### Pass Pallet

The `pass` pallet provides a robust authentication and account management system for Substrate-based blockchains. It implements a flexible authentication mechanism that supports multiple devices and session keys.

#### Key Features

- Multi-device authentication support
- Session key management
- Account registration with deposit system
- Device attestation and verification
- Flexible storage pricing

#### Configuration

```rust
impl pallet_pass::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type PalletsOrigin = OriginCaller;
    type RuntimeCall = RuntimeCall;
    type WeightInfo = ();
    type RegisterOrigin = EitherOf<
        EnsureRootWithSuccess<Self::AccountId, RootAccount>,
        EnsureSigned<Self::AccountId>,
    >;
    type AddressGenerator = ();
    type Balances = Balances;
    type Authenticator = PassAuthenticator;
    type Scheduler = Scheduler;
    type BlockNumberProvider = System;
    type RegistrarConsideration = RootDoesNotPayConsideration<
        HoldConsideration<AccountId, Balances, HoldAccountRegistration, RegistrationStoragePrice>,
    >;
    type DeviceConsideration = FirstItemIsFree<
        HoldConsideration<AccountId, Balances, HoldAccountDevices, ItemStoragePrice>,
    >;
    type SessionKeyConsideration = FirstItemIsFree<
        HoldConsideration<AccountId, Balances, HoldSessionKeys, ItemStoragePrice>
    >;
    type PalletId = PassPalletId;
    type MaxSessionDuration = ConstU64<10>;
    #[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]
    type BenchmarkHelper = benchmarks::BenchmarkHelper;
}
```

### Communities Pallet

The `communities` pallet provides functionality for managing communities within a blockchain network.

#### Key Features

- Community creation and management
- Member management
- Role-based access control
- Community governance

#### Configuration

```rust
impl pallet_communities::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type WeightInfo = ();
    // ... additional configuration
}
```

### Gas Transaction Payment Pallet

The `gas-transaction-payment` pallet implements a flexible gas payment system for transactions.

#### Key Features

- Configurable gas pricing
- Support for multiple payment methods
- Gas tank functionality
- Transaction fee management

#### Configuration

```rust
impl pallet_gas_transaction_payment::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type WeightInfo = ();
    // ... additional configuration
}
```

### Listings Pallet

The `listings` pallet provides functionality for managing listings in a marketplace.

#### Key Features

- Listing creation and management
- Listing categories
- Listing status tracking
- Listing verification

#### Configuration

```rust
impl pallet_listings::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type WeightInfo = ();

}
```

### Orders Pallet

The `orders` pallet implements order management functionality for marketplaces.

#### Key Features

- Order creation and tracking
- Order status management
- Order fulfillment
- Order dispute resolution

#### Configuration

```rust
impl pallet_orders::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
