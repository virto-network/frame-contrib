//! # Communities Pallet
//!
//! This pallet enables people to form dynamic collectives refered to as
//! communities. In simpler terms, it can be considered a DAO Factory.
//!
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Config`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Communities pallet provides functionality for managing communities,
//! facilitating its participants to have governance over the community entity
//! (and its associated account) which can interect with other systems:
//!
//! - Community registration and removal.
//! - Enrolling/removing members from a community.
//! - Promoting/demoting members within the community.
//! - Voting on proposals to enable community governance.
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! - **Community:** An entity comprised of _members_ —each one defined by their
//!   [`AccountId`][1]— with a given _description_ who can vote on _proposals_
//!   and actively take decisions on behalf of it. Communities are given a
//!   _treasury account_ they can use to hold assets.
//! - **Community Description:** A set of metadata used to identify a community
//!   distinctively. Typically, a name, a description and a URL.
//! - **Community Status:** A community can be either `active` or `blocked`.
//! - **Member:** An [`AccountId`][1] registered into the community as such. Can
//!   have a rank within it and vote in the community's polls.
//! - **Member Rank:** Members could have a rank within the community. This can
//!   determine a voting weight depending on the community's voting mechanism.
//! - **Proposal:** A poll that executes a [call][2] dispatch if approved when
//!   it's closed.
//! - **Community Account:** A keyless [`AccountId`][1] generated on behalf of
//!   the community. Like any regular account can hold balances. It can transfer
//!   funds via a privileged call executed by the community _admin_ or a call
//!   dispatched from a proposal.
//! - **Decision Method:** Can be either rank weighed, member-counted, or
//!   asset-weighed and determines how the votes of proposals will be tallied.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! ```ignore
//! [       ] --> [Pending]               --> [Active]            --> [Blocked]
//! create        set_metadata                set_metadata            unblock
//!                                           block                   
//!                                           add_member              
//!                                           remove_member
//!                                           promote
//!                                           demote
//!                                           set_voting_mechanism
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementations
//!
//! > TODO: Define which traits we are defining/implementing.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Permissionless Functions
//!
//! - [`apply_for`][c00]: Registers an appliation as a new community, taking an
//!   [existential deposit][3] used to create the community account.
//!
//! ### Permissioned Functions
//!
//! Calling these functions requires being a member of the community.
//!
//! - [`add_member`][c02]: Enroll an account as a community member. In theory,
//!   any community member should be able to add a member. However, this can be
//!   changed to ensure it is a privileged function.
//! - `vote`: Adds a vote into a community proposal.
//!
//! ### Privileged Functions
//!
//! These functions can be called either by the community _admin_ or
//! dispatched through an approved proposal. !
//! - [`remove_member`][c03]: Removes an account as a community member. While
//!   enrolling a member into the community can be an action taken by any
//!   member, the decision to remove a member should not be taken arbitrarily by
//!   any community member. Also, it shouldn't be possible to arbitrarily remove
//!   the community admin, as some privileged calls would be impossible execute
//!   thereafter.
//! - `promote`: Increases the rank of a member in the community.
//! - `demote`: Decreases the rank of a member in the community.
//! - `set_decision_method`: Means for a community to make decisions.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! - [`community`][g00]: Stores the basic information of the community. If a
//!   value exists for a specified [`ComumunityId`][t00], this means a community
//!   exists.
//! - [`metadata`][g01]: Stores the metadata regarding a community.
